# RandomMapGenerator
Creates randomly generated 2D tile maps using the SFML library





Uses an algorithm that adds columns and rows to a 1 dimensional vector that is represented in 2 dimensions. 
Then uses a version of nearest neighbor interpolation to determine the value at the points in the newly created rows and columns.
